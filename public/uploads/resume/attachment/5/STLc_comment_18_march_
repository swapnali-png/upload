Today I studied  STLC  and its different phases :-



1) It stands for Software Testing Life Cycle. STLC process defines various activities to improve the quality of the product.

2) STLC is a sequence of different activities performed by testing team.

3) STLC is a integral part of SDLC. But STLC deals only with testing phases.

4) STLC provides a step by step process to ensure quality software.

5) This is helps to find bugs/error in the initial phase.

6) STLC has different phases which are as follow :-


Test Requirement Phase :- find out requirement testable or not

Test Analysis Phase :- Identification of the test condition

Text Planing Phase :- Identify the activity

Test Case Designing Phase :- Develop the test cases based on scope

Implementation Phase :- Environment Setup

Test Execution Phase :- Actual execution

Test Conclusion Phase :- DSR-Daily Status Report and WSR-Weekly status Report

Test Closure Phase :- Scope of improvement


Bug Life Cycle :-



1) Bug life cycle is also known as Defect life cycle in software testing

2) Following are the different states of defect/bug life cycle :-
       New , Assigned, Open, Fixed, Pending retest, Retest, Verified, Reopen, Closed, Duplicate, Rejected, Not a Bug



"Reopened" status can used by Developer for bug update.



Bugzilla :-



1) Bugzilla is a web based general purpose bug tracking system and testing tool.

3)Also It is a  defect tracking tool.

4) It widely used for bug reporting tool for all types of testing function.
